# PRODIGY_DS_04
TASK-04:
Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.

Sample Dataset :- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis

Topic:
Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.

Sample Dataset:
Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis

Goal:
To process and analyze social media data, perform sentiment analysis, and build a model to classify sentiments accurately. Additionally, visualize the sentiment patterns to provide insights into public opinion.

Key Highlights
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the distribution of sentiments and key features.
Feature Extraction: Transforming text data into numerical data using techniques like TF-IDF.
Model Building: Training machine learning models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to classify sentiments.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Graphical representation of sentiment patterns to understand public opinion.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for all tasks.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
NLTK: Natural language processing for tokenization and text preprocessing.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model building and evaluation.
PyTorch: Deep learning framework for building neural network models.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Visualization libraries for plotting data and results.
Detailed Explanation 
1) Data Preprocessing
Load the dataset and check for missing values.
Clean the text data by removing special characters, stopwords, and performing tokenization.
Lemmatize the text to reduce words to their base form.

2)Feature Extraction
Transform text data into numerical data using TF-IDF.

3)Model Building
Split the data into training and validation sets.
Train a Random Forest classifier and evaluate its performance.

4)Visualization
Visualize sentiment distribution and model performance.
